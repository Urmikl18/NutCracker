Salgado began     his career at the youth ranks of top Mexican side Guadaljara. He courted controversy when he leaved the Mexican club to pursue a career with the United States U-20 national team.[1]He had previously played for Mexico at U-20[2] and U-17 level.[3]

Salgado signed with Major League Soccer shortly after leaving Chivas and was made eligible for the 2011 MLS SuperDraft. In the meantime, he trained with the Vancouver Whitecaps,[4] Portland Timbers[4] and Everton.[1] He was chosen first overall in the 2011 MLS SuperDraft by Vancouver, and made his professional debut on April 10, 2011 in a game against Houston Dynamo. He scored his first professional goal in his full debut for the Whitecaps on April 30, 2011 against the Columbus Crew.

In September 2011, Salgado received a passport of Spain (by way of a Spanish grandfather), clearing the way for a potential move to Europe.[5]
